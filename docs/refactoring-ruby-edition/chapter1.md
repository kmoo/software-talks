# Chapter 1

## Foreword


- I really agreed with his sentiment on `pp. xiii` about not finding as much value in just learning OOP then design patterns, but finding the most value when learning the principles behind things (like we do in learning about refactoring). In my mind, those principles often manifest in our subconscious as code smells, which [like Sandi Metz talks about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2yFMzxqwU&list=PLqal2KPbpmUwQurG_ixyT9pAHcesUjvJ5) (you can find my notes on that great talk here -> [notes](../solid_object_oriented_design_by_sandi_metz.md)), and lead us to following [SOLID](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2009/03/21/solid-design-principles) better (and vv).

> Good code is easy to change.
> Bad code can incrementally be made easier to change.
> Code that's easy to change is fun to work with.
> Code that's hard to change is stressful to work with.
> And the more changes you make, without refactoring it, the more stressful working with it becomes.

- I love that he was carrying the "Refactoring" book around with him to meetings... (`pp. xiv`)

> Our work can be great if we always remember that it should be great and we take the simple steps to _make_ it great.

- "The techniques in this book were born out of Smalltalk development" - so many great engineers were involved with Smalltalk...
