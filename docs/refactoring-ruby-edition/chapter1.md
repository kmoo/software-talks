## Notes

> The key to testing is running tests after every small change so _when_ you mess up you don't have to look in many places to find the problem.
> Comparing the failing version of code to a previous working version (which I call Diff Debugging) is a useful technique, particularly so when the diffs are small.
> Because each change is so small, any errors are easy to find.

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
> Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

> I often refactor when I'm reading some code.
> That way as I gain understanding, about the program, I embed that understanding into the code for later so I don't forget what I learned.
