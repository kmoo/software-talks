## Notes

### Where Did Refactoring Come From?

> In this book I'm advocating refactoring as a key element in the whole process of software development.
>
> â€“ _Refactoring: Ruby Edition, Chapter 2, pp. 51_

- It is a cultural shift that we need - it's not enough to just like or agree with refactoring, but it needs to be made a part of the software development process.

- There's lots of good history here. I don't think I could adequately capture it. But it's all on page 51-52.

### Defining Refactoring

- There are two definitons of "refactoring':
  - `"Refactoring (noun): A change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior."`
  - `"Refactor (verb): To restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior."`
## Discussion Notes

- I sadly missed the discussion.
