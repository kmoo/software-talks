# Preface

## What is Refactoring?

> _Refactoring_ is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.
> It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs.
> In essence, when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.
> 
> – _Refactoring: Ruby Edition, Preface, pp. xv_

This felt like it was written for me. Very convicting!:

> Over time the code gets modified, and the integrity of the system, its structure according to that design, gradually fades.
> The code slowly sinks from engineering to hacking.
>
> – _Refactoring: Ruby Edition, Preface, pp. xvi_

> With refactoring you can take a bad design, chaos even, and rework it into well-designed code.
>
> – _Refactoring: Ruby Edition, Preface, pp. xvi_

> With refactoring[...] You find that design, rather than occuring all up front, occurs continuously during develpment.
> You learn from building the system how to improve the design.
